###### Token parser microservice
PHP JWT parser did not work properly that's why used python jwt parser as a separate microservice
you can find parser source code inside of ```jwt_parser``` folder of the repository

json format to parse jwt:
```
{
    "jwt":"ey<token_id from singpass token endpoint>",
    "key":   {    
             "kty": "EC",
             "d": "<generated key>",
             "use": "enc",
             "crv": "P-256",
             "kid": "example_enc_key",
             "x": "<generated key>",
             "y": "<generated key>",
             "alg": "ECDH-ES+A128KW"}
}
```

        }
    ]
}
```
###### Private signing X.509 key
``` X.509``` format generated key, used to sign data,
https://mkjwk.org/ service provides generating such kind of keys together with JSON view
```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
<generated key>
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```


###### Private encryption X.509 key
``` X.509``` format generated key, used to encrypt data,
https://mkjwk.org/ service provides generating such kind of keys together with JSON view
